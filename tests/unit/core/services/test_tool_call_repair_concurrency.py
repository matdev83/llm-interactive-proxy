"""
Concurrency regression tests for ToolCallRepairService.

These tests detect the race condition bug that was fixed by making the service stateless.
If the service is ever refactored to use shared mutable state (like _last_tool_snippet),
these tests will fail.

        Regression test: Verify that concurrent tool call repairs don't interfere.

        This test would FAIL if the service used shared mutable state like _last_tool_snippet.

        The bug scenario:
        1. Thread A calls repair_tool_calls() with tool X
        2. Thread B calls repair_tool_calls() with tool Y
        3. Thread B overwrites shared _last_tool_snippet
        4. Thread A tries to use snippet but gets Thread B's snippet
        5. Result: Incorrect snippet returned

        This test ensures each concurrent call gets its own correct snippet atomically.
