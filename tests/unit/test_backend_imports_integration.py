Integration test for backend_imports module.

This test verifies that the backend_imports module correctly triggers
connector auto-discovery when imported, which is critical for the CLI
to function properly.

This test was created after a bug where backend_imports.py was empty,
causing the CLI to not load any connectors even though the auto-discovery
mechanism in src/connectors/__init__.py existed.
