Kiro is a newly launched AI-powered integrated development environment (IDE) from Amazon Web Services (AWS), designed to streamline the software development process from initial concept to production. It introduces a spec-driven development approach, aiming to bring structure and clarity to projects that often start with informal or exploratory coding, commonly referred to as "vibe coding"

Key Features of Kiro
Spec-Driven Development: Kiro transforms natural language prompts into structured specifications, including requirements, design documents, and task lists. This methodology helps in planning and understanding the system's behavior before diving into code, facilitating a smoother transition from prototype to production .
