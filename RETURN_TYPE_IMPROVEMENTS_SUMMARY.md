# Summary of Return Type Improvements

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Anthropic Connector
- Modified `_handle_non_streaming_response` method in `src/connectors/anthropic.py` to return a `ResponseEnvelope` directly instead of a tuple
- Updated the `chat_completions` method to handle the new return type properly

### 2. Fixed Test Cases
- Updated test cases in `tests/unit/core/test_backend_service_enhanced.py` to correctly access the response content
- Fixed assertions that were expecting a nested `content.content` structure to just expect `content`

## Benefits

1. **Consistent Return Types**: All connectors now return consistent types (`ResponseEnvelope | StreamingResponseEnvelope`)
2. **Simplified Code**: Removed complex type checking logic that was needed to handle different return types
3. **Better Maintainability**: Code is easier to understand and maintain with consistent return types
4. **Type Safety**: Improved type safety with explicit return types

## Verification

- All Anthropic connector tests pass
- All backend service tests pass
- No breaking changes to the public API
