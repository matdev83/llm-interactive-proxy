# Fix Summary for LLM Interactive Proxy

## Issues Addressed

### 1. SessionStateAdapter Missing Methods
**Problem**: The `SessionStateAdapter` class was missing several methods that were expected by command implementations.

**Solution**: Added the missing methods to the `SessionStateAdapter` class:
- `with_backend_config`, `with_reasoning_config`, `with_project`, `with_project_dir`
- `with_interactive_just_enabled`
- Properties like `interactive_mode`, `set_override_backend`, `unset_override_backend`, `set_override_model`, `set_project`, `set_project_dir`, `set_interactive_mode`

### 2. Missing `register_services` Function
**Problem**: Tests were trying to import `register_services` from `application_factory.py`, but the function didn't exist.

**Solution**: Added the `register_services` function to `application_factory.py` with proper implementation for backward compatibility.

### 3. Configuration Access Issues
**Problem**: Tests were trying to set configuration values using item assignment (e.g., `app.state.config["disable_auth"] = True`), but `AppConfig` objects don't support this.

**Solution**: Updated test files to properly update `AppConfig` objects:
- Changed `app.state.config["disable_auth"] = True` to `config.auth.disable_auth = True`

### 4. Test Mocking Updates
**Problem**: Several tests were using outdated mocking approaches that didn't work with the new architecture.

**Solution**: Updated test fixtures and mocking approaches to work with the new dependency injection system.

## Files Modified

1. `src/core/domain/session.py` - Added missing methods to `SessionStateAdapter`
2. `src/core/app/application_factory.py` - Added `register_services` function
3. `tests/integration/test_failover_routes.py` - Fixed configuration access
4. `tests/integration/test_oneoff_command_integration.py` - Fixed configuration access
5. `tests/integration/test_updated_hybrid_controller.py` - Updated test implementations

## Remaining Issues

### Test Infrastructure Issues
Some tests are still failing due to:
1. Incorrect mocking of service providers
2. Missing imports in test files
3. Tests expecting specific response formats that mocks don't provide

### Authentication Issues
Some integration tests are failing due to authentication requirements when no API keys are configured.

### Hybrid Controller Tests
The hybrid controller tests need further updates to properly mock the response formats expected by the converters.

## Recommendations

1. **Continue updating test infrastructure**: Update remaining tests to work with the new architecture
2. **Fix authentication in tests**: Ensure tests can run without requiring real API keys
3. **Standardize response mocking**: Create helper functions for mocking responses in the expected formats
4. **Update documentation**: Document the changes to help future developers understand the new architecture

## Verification

Run the following command to verify the fixes:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/unit/test_config_persistence.py tests/unit/test_model_discovery.py -v
```
