# Contributing to LLM Interactive Proxy

We welcome contributions to the LLM Interactive Proxy! This guide provides an overview of the development workflow, architectural guidelines, and best practices for contributing to the project.

## Development Workflow

### Setting Up Development Environment

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-org/llm-interactive-proxy.git
    cd llm-interactive-proxy
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:

    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**:
    - Windows: `.\.venv\Scripts\activate`
    - Unix: `source .venv/bin/activate`
4. **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    pip install -e .[dev]
    ```

5. **Create a `.env` file**: With your API keys (see `README.md` for details).

### Running the Application

```bash
# Run with default settings
python -m src.core.cli

# Run with custom configuration
python -m src.core.cli --config path/to/config.yaml

# Run with different backends
python -m src.core.cli --default-backend openrouter
python -m src.core.cli --default-backend gemini
python -m src.core.cli --default-backend anthropic
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/unit/test_backend_service.py

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest --cov=src
```

### Linting and Formatting

```bash
# Run ruff
python -m ruff check src

# Run black
python -m black src

# Run mypy
python -m mypy src
```

## Architecture Overview

The LLM Interactive Proxy follows a clean architecture approach based on SOLID principles:

- **S**ingle Responsibility Principle: Each class has one responsibility.
- **O**pen/Closed Principle: Open for extension, closed for modification.
- **L**iskov Substitution Principle: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
- **I**nterface Segregation Principle: Clients shouldn't depend on methods they don't use.
- **D**ependency Inversion Principle: High-level modules depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations.

### Key Architectural Layers

1. **Interface Layer** (`src/core/interfaces/`): Defines contracts (abstract base classes) for services.
2. **Domain Layer** (`src/core/domain/`): Contains business entities and value objects; implements domain logic using immutable models.
3. **Application Layer** (`src/core/app/`): Orchestrates application flow, connects domain to infrastructure, contains controllers and middleware.
4. **Service Layer** (`src/core/services/`): Implements business use cases, orchestrates domain objects, depends on interfaces.
5. **Infrastructure Layer** (`src/core/repositories/`, `src/connectors/`): Implements interfaces, handles data storage and external services, provides adapters.

## Architecture Patterns and Best Practices

### 1. Interface-Driven Development

Define interfaces before implementations. Services interact through interfaces, enabling dependency inversion and clean testing.

### 2. Dependency Injection

Use a DI container to manage service dependencies, promoting loose coupling and easier testing.

### 3. Domain Models

Use immutable Pydantic models for core business entities to ensure data integrity and prevent accidental modifications. Use `.model_copy()` for modifications.

### 4. Command Pattern

Use command handlers for processing interactive commands.

### 5. Middleware Pipeline

Use middleware for cross-cutting concerns like response processing.

### 6. Repository Pattern

Use repositories for data access operations.

### 7. Factory Pattern

Use factories for creating complex objects, such as backend instances.

## Testing Guidelines

### 1. Unit Testing

Test individual components in isolation, using mock dependencies where necessary.

### 2. Integration Testing

Test how components work together, focusing on request-to-response flows.

### 3. End-to-End Testing

Test complete request flows to ensure overall system functionality.

### Testing with Dependency Injection Architecture

- **Integration Tests**: Use `setup_test_command_registry()` from `tests/conftest.py` to set up the DI command registry with mock dependencies.
- **Unit Tests**: Create mock dependencies and instantiate commands directly. For `CommandParser` tests, use mock commands from `tests/unit/mock_commands.py`.
- **Stateful Commands**: Create mock dependencies for `ISecureStateAccess` and `ISecureStateModification` and pass them to the command constructor.
- **Skipped Tests**: Update previously skipped tests to use the new DI-based commands.

## Code Quality

- **Code Style**: Follow PEP 8 with type hints, use Ruff for linting, and Black for formatting.
- **SOLID Principles**: Adhere to SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, and DIP.
- **DRY**: Avoid code duplication.
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Write tests first.
- **Error Handling**: Use specific exceptions and meaningful error messages.

## Contribution Process

1. **Create a feature branch**: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
2. **Write tests** for new functionality.
3. **Ensure all tests pass**: `pytest`
4. **Update documentation** as needed.
5. **Submit a Pull Request** with a clear description following the Conventional Commits format (`type(scope): subject`).
6. **Address review comments**.
7. **Merge after approval**.
