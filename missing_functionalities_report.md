# Missing Functionalities Report

## Executive Summary

After a thorough analysis of the codebase, I've identified several functionalities that were present in the pre-SOLID refactoring but are either missing, incomplete, or improperly implemented in the new SOLID-based architecture. This report outlines these gaps and provides recommendations for addressing them.

## 1. Missing Command Handlers

### 1.1 Set Command Handler

While the legacy codebase has a comprehensive `SetCommand` implementation in `src/commands/set_cmd.py`, the new SOLID architecture has only a partial implementation:

- There is a `SetCommandRefactored` class in `src/core/commands/set_command.py`, but it's not properly integrated into the command handler system.
- The new architecture has individual handlers for specific settings (Backend, Model, Temperature, Project), but doesn't have a unified `SetCommandHandler` that can handle all settings.
- Many settings from the legacy `SetCommand` are not supported, including:
  - `reasoning-effort`
  - `thinking-budget`
  - `gemini-generation-config`
  - `openai_url`
  - `loop-detection`
  - `tool-loop-detection`
  - `tool-loop-max-repeats`
  - `tool-loop-ttl`
  - `tool-loop-mode`

### 1.2 Unset Command Handler

The legacy codebase has an `UnsetCommand` implementation in `src/commands/unset_cmd.py`, but there is no equivalent in the new SOLID architecture:

- No `UnsetCommandHandler` class exists in the new architecture.
- The functionality to unset previously configured options is missing.
- The ability to reset to default values is not implemented.

## 2. Incomplete Command Registration

The command handler factory in `src/core/commands/handler_factory.py` registers several command handlers, but it's missing registration for:

- Set command handler (unified version)
- Unset command handler
- Project directory command handler

## 3. Configuration Options Not Fully Supported

While the domain models in `src/core/domain/configuration/` are well-designed and support all the necessary configuration options, not all of these options are accessible through command handlers:

- `reasoning_effort`, `thinking_budget`, and `gemini_generation_config` in `ReasoningConfiguration` don't have corresponding command handlers.
- `tool_loop_max_repeats`, `tool_loop_ttl_seconds`, and `tool_loop_mode` in `LoopDetectionConfiguration` don't have corresponding command handlers.

## 4. Missing Project Directory Command

While there is a `ProjectCommandHandler` that can set the project name, there's no equivalent handler for setting the project directory:

- The legacy codebase allows setting the project directory, but this functionality is missing in the new architecture.
- The `ProjectConfiguration` class in `src/core/domain/configuration/project_config.py` supports `project_dir`, but there's no command handler to set it.

## 5. Recommendations

### 5.1 Implement Missing Command Handlers

1. Create a unified `SetCommandHandler` that can handle all settings, delegating to specific handlers when available.
2. Implement an `UnsetCommandHandler` to reset configuration options.
3. Create a `ProjectDirCommandHandler` for setting the project directory.

### 5.2 Complete Command Registration

Update `src/core/commands/handler_factory.py` to register all the missing command handlers.

### 5.3 Implement Specialized Setting Handlers

Create specialized handlers for:
- `ReasoningEffortHandler`
- `ThinkingBudgetHandler`
- `GeminiGenerationConfigHandler`
- `ToolLoopDetectionHandler`
- `ToolLoopMaxRepeatsHandler`
- `ToolLoopTTLHandler`
- `ToolLoopModeHandler`

### 5.4 Update Documentation

Update the API reference documentation to include all the supported commands and their options.

## 6. Conclusion

While the new SOLID architecture is well-designed and provides a solid foundation, there are several missing functionalities that need to be implemented to achieve feature parity with the legacy codebase. By addressing the gaps identified in this report, the new architecture will provide a complete replacement for the legacy code.
