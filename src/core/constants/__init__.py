"""Constants module for the LLM Interactive Proxy.

This module contains various constants used throughout the application and tests
to make the codebase more maintainable and the tests less fragile.

# We are using wildcard imports here to make all constants easily accessible
# from a single import point. This is a deliberate design choice for convenience.
