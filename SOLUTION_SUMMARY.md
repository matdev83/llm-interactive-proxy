# Solution Summary: Fixing Configuration Classes

## Problem
The configuration classes (`ReasoningConfiguration`, `BackendConfiguration`, and `LoopDetectionConfiguration`) were experiencing field access issues where their properties were returning `None` instead of the actual values. This was caused by inheriting from both `ValueObject` and their respective interfaces, which created conflicts between field names and interface properties.

## Root Cause
When a Pydantic model inherits from an interface that has properties with the same names as the model fields, and `extra='ignore'` is set in the model configuration, the fields are ignored entirely due to the shadowing warning suppression.

## Solution
1. **Removed Interface Inheritance**: Removed inheritance from the interfaces (`IReasoningConfig`, `IBackendConfig`, `ILoopDetectionConfig`) from the configuration classes. The classes still comply with the interfaces through their field names and method signatures.

2. **Removed `extra='ignore'` Configuration**: Removed the `extra='ignore'` setting from the model configuration since it was no longer needed and was causing the fields to be ignored.

3. **Fixed Return Types**: Updated the return types of all `with_*` methods to return the concrete class type instead of the interface type for better type safety and method chaining.

## Files Modified
1. `src/core/domain/configuration/reasoning_config.py`
2. `src/core/domain/configuration/backend_config.py`
3. `src/core/domain/configuration/loop_detection_config.py`

## Testing
All configuration interface tests now pass, confirming that the changes have resolved the issue without breaking any existing functionality:
- `TestBackendConfigInterface`: All tests pass
- `TestReasoningConfigInterface`: All tests pass
- `TestLoopDetectionConfigInterface`: All tests pass
- `TestConfigurationDefaults`: All tests pass
- `TestConfigurationImmutability`: All tests pass

## Impact
This fix ensures that:
1. Configuration objects properly store and retrieve their values
2. Method chaining works correctly
3. Type safety is maintained
4. Interface compliance is preserved
5. Immutability is maintained (configuration objects are still frozen)
