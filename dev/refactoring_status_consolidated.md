## Executive summary

The repository is mid-migration to a SOLID/DIP architecture. Foundational work (DI container, application factory, backend registration, configuration normalization) has progressed and fixed many systemic startup failures. Remaining work is focused on runtime/business-logic issues, test fixtures, interface drift, and streaming/async correctness.

Use this file as the canonical tracking point for progress, decisions, and remaining tasks. Update this file with short changelog entries when you apply fixes.

## Top priorities (summary)

1) Backend initialization & DI binding issues — ensure connectors are imported/registered and DI supplies required constructor args.
2) Async/await and streaming handling — audit missing `await` and fix streaming iterators consumption.
3) Session state and type mismatches — align test fixtures and `SessionStateAdapter` usage.
4) Request shape validation — convert Pydantic models to dicts where legacy code expects them.
5) Test fixtures & httpx mock alignment — add missing mocks and align mock URLs.

## Consolidated TODO (actionable items)

- [ ] Register `IBackendConfigProvider` in DI and refactor `BackendService` usage
- [ ] Implement `_initialize_legacy_backends` to attach legacy backends to `app.state`
- [ ] Fix missing `await` calls and streaming handling in connectors and processor
- [ ] Add conversion helpers (Pydantic -> dict) and update validation for command-only requests
- [ ] Add missing test fixtures (e.g., `mock_openai`) and update `tests/conftest.py`
- [ ] Fix SessionStateAdapter persistence semantics and test usage
- [ ] Ensure middleware and processors (loop detector) register on startup
- [ ] Run Ruff → Black → Ruff → Mypy QA gate after edits

## Quick usage notes

- When running format/type tools use the project's venv: `.venv/Scripts/python -m <tool>`
- For QA: `.venv/Scripts/python -m ruff check src test tests --fix`, then Black, then Ruff, then Mypy.

## Changelog

- 2025-08-17: Consolidated all `dev/*.md` into this file and archived originals to `dev/archive/` (files moved: ARCHITECTURE_IMPROVEMENTS.md, PRIORITIZED_FAILURE_CATEGORIES.md, ROADBLOCK_FIX_SUMMARY.md, solid_implementation_issues_report.md, SOLID_implementation_summary.md, TODO_ARCHITECTURE_TASKS.md, fix_highest_priority_problems.md, remaining_roadblocks.txt, workflows/*). — automated consolidation

- 2025-08-19: Removed debug prints from production code, added adapter-based validation for backend/model in `SetCommand`, improved `CommandProcessor` state application, and archived dev notes. Ran focused unit tests for proxy/commands — all proxy_logic tests passed. — automated edits

## Latest test run (2025-08-19)

- Command: full pytest run including integration tests via `.venv`
- Result summary: **64 failed**, **485 passed**, **24 skipped**, **213 deselected**, **14 errors**, **1 warning** (see `pytest_full_run.log`)

### Top observed failure categories (from test output)
- **Command handling / set_command bug**: multiple tests fail with `UnboundLocalError: local variable 'base_command' referenced before assignment` originating in `src/core/commands/set_command.py` — this appears to be a logic bug in exception handling when importing `BaseCommand`.
- **Session state / command persistence**: Many assertions show session state not being updated (e.g., `backend_config.backend_type` remains None, `interactive_just_enabled` not cleared). Focus on `SessionStateAdapter` and how command handlers persist new state.
- **HTTP mocks / pytest-httpx issues**: Errors about unexpected keyword `allow_missing_responses` and mocked responses not being requested; update `pytest-httpx` usage/config or test fixtures.
- **Missing methods on mock backends**: Several tests fail because mocks don't implement `chat_completions` and other expected connector methods — update mock factory in `tests/test_backend_factory.py`.
- **500 Internal Server Errors across endpoints**: Many tests hitting endpoints return 500, indicating unhandled exceptions in request pipeline (likely tied to the above issues).
- **Misc runtime type errors**: e.g., `TypeError: 'tuple' object is not callable` in regression tests — investigate recent refactors that return tuples where callables expected.

### Immediate recommended next steps
1. Fix the `UnboundLocalError` in `src/core/commands/set_command.py` (inspect `BaseCommand` import/exception handling and ensure `base_command` is defined before use).
2. Audit `SessionStateAdapter` and command handlers to ensure state updates persist to `Session` objects used by tests.
3. Update test backend factory and mocks to implement required connector methods (`chat_completions`, streaming behavior) and align with SOLID adapters.
4. Review pytest-httpx usage in tests and update mock options (remove unsupported `allow_missing_responses` usages and set allow_unused/non-matching behavior where appropriate).
5. Re-run focused unit test subsets (proxy/command tests) after the above fixes, then re-run full suite.

The `pytest_full_run.log` file contains the complete transcript and can be reviewed for specific stack traces.
