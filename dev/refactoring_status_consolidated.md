## Executive summary

The repository is mid-migration to a SOLID/DIP architecture. Foundational work (DI container, application factory, backend registration, configuration normalization) has progressed and fixed many systemic startup failures. Remaining work is focused on runtime/business-logic issues, test fixtures, interface drift, and streaming/async correctness.

Use this file as the canonical tracking point for progress, decisions, and remaining tasks. Update this file with short changelog entries when you apply fixes.

## Top priorities (summary)

1) Backend initialization & DI binding issues — ensure connectors are imported/registered and DI supplies required constructor args.
2) Async/await and streaming handling — audit missing `await` and fix streaming iterators consumption.
3) Session state and type mismatches — align test fixtures and `SessionStateAdapter` usage.
4) Request shape validation — convert Pydantic models to dicts where legacy code expects them.
5) Test fixtures & httpx mock alignment — add missing mocks and align mock URLs.

## Consolidated TODO (actionable items)

- [ ] Register `IBackendConfigProvider` in DI and refactor `BackendService` usage
- [ ] Implement `_initialize_legacy_backends` to attach legacy backends to `app.state`
- [ ] Fix missing `await` calls and streaming handling in connectors and processor
- [ ] Add conversion helpers (Pydantic -> dict) and update validation for command-only requests
- [ ] Add missing test fixtures (e.g., `mock_openai`) and update `tests/conftest.py`
- [ ] Fix SessionStateAdapter persistence semantics and test usage
- [ ] Ensure middleware and processors (loop detector) register on startup
- [ ] Run Ruff → Black → Ruff → Mypy QA gate after edits

## Quick usage notes

- When running format/type tools use the project's venv: `.venv/Scripts/python -m <tool>`
- For QA: `.venv/Scripts/python -m ruff check src test tests --fix`, then Black, then Ruff, then Mypy.
