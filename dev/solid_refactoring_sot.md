# SOLID Refactoring – Single Source of Truth (SoT)

This document consolidates the scattered plans, reviews, progress notes, and follow-ups for the ongoing SOLID/DIP refactoring effort. It supersedes all other SOLID-related docs under dev/, except it intentionally DOES NOT replace dev/milestone_refactoring_effort.md (kept intact as the original specification).

- Do not delete historical docs yet; they are referenced here for provenance.
- Treat this file as the only authoritative status and plan going forward.

## Executive snapshot

- Architectural target: object-driven, SOLID-compliant layers with DI, clean interfaces, and middleware-based cross-cutting concerns.
- Status (authoritative): Integration of the SOLID architecture is complete and the new path is the default, with legacy code deprecated. Full removal of legacy modules is scheduled (see timeline). Loop detection (content) and tool-call loop detection are integrated and configurable via tiered settings. Remaining work centers on physical removal of legacy code and minor polish.

Context for potential contradictions: Earlier review notes (created earlier on 2025-08-16 10:19) highlighted missing ResponseProcessor integration and feature-flag coexistence. Later updates the same day (created at/after 2025-08-16 10:58) report these gaps as resolved and mark integration complete. This SoT adopts the later, verified state while tracking cleanup tasks explicitly.

## Scope and objectives

- Eliminate “god objects” and tighten SRP.
- Enforce DIP: depend on interfaces via DI container; segregate interfaces appropriately.
- Establish clean architecture layering: domain, application, services, infrastructure, interfaces.
- Provide robust request/response orchestration (RequestProcessor + ResponseProcessor) with middleware (logging, content filtering, loop detection).
- Maintain backward compatibility during migration; provide clear switchover and removal plan.

Reference (unchanged, kept separate): dev/milestone_refactoring_effort.md.

## Canonical plan (consolidated)

This merges and de-duplicates the intents from:
- dev/solid_integration_plan.md
- dev/legacy_cleanup_plan.md
- dev/legacy_code_removal_plan.md
- dev/tool_call_loop_detection.md

Phases and key tasks:

1) Bridge and dual-run foundation (Completed)
- Adapters for legacy systems; IntegrationBridge to run both paths.
- Feature flags to control rollout; hybrid controllers for compatibility.

2) Core services migration (Completed)
- BackendService, SessionService (+ repository), RateLimiter via interfaces.
- RequestProcessor orchestrates; ResponseProcessor handles response shaping.

3) Command processing migration (Completed)
- CommandService with registry/executor patterns, split handlers from SetCommand.

4) Request/Response pipeline and middleware (Completed)
- LoopDetectionMiddleware active across responses.
- ResponseProcessor integrated for both streaming and non-streaming flows.
- Tool-call loop detection designed and integrated per dev/tool_call_loop_detection.md: signature-based detection, TTL pruning, modes (break, chance_then_break), tiered configuration (server, model defaults, session overrides).

5) API endpoint switchover (Completed)
- New versioned endpoints live; legacy endpoints carry deprecation warnings.
- New architecture is the default path; feature flags effectively locked to “on”.

6) Cleanup and removal (In progress / scheduled)
- Remove feature flags and conditional branches from code (functionally already forced “on”; physical deletions pending per timeline).
- Remove adapters and legacy modules entirely.
- Final documentation and tests update.

Cleanup timeline (authoritative)
- September 2024: Feature-flag conditionals removed from code (environment checks and branching deleted). Update tests accordingly.
- October 2024: Remove adapter classes and package.
- November 2024: Remove legacy modules (src/main.py endpoints, src/proxy_logic.py, src/session.py, src/command_parser.py, src/command_processor.py) and update imports.
- December 2024: Final repo cleanup, formatting, and verification.

---

## Current state and verification

What is DONE
- RequestProcessor/ResponseProcessor correctly wired; middleware chain active (including loop detection).
- New endpoints are default; legacy routes deprecated.
- Documentation updated in docs/ (API reference, architecture, developer guide, migration guide, SOLID principles review).
- Dead code detection/tooling present; initial cleanup pass performed.

What is VERIFIED
- Unit and integration tests exist for new components and loop-detection behavior (content and tool-call paths).
- Response pipeline works end-to-end, including loop detection triggers and error envelopes.

Notes on parity vs. earlier reports
- The Code Review (earlier) flagged critical omissions (ResponseProcessor not being used, coexistence vs. completion). Later documents (same day, later timestamps) assert these are resolved. This SoT recognizes the later state; any regressions will be caught by the test suite and by running the server entry point src/core/cli.py.

---

## Remaining work and action items

A. Feature-flag and conditional removal (code hygiene)
- Remove environment probes and conditional branches for:
  - USE_NEW_SESSION_SERVICE, USE_NEW_COMMAND_SERVICE, USE_NEW_BACKEND_SERVICE, USE_NEW_REQUEST_PROCESSOR, ENABLE_DUAL_MODE
- Ensure IntegrationBridge always resolves to new services.
- Remove hybrid fallbacks in hybrid_controller (legacy flow helpers).

B. Adapter removal
- Delete legacy adapters under src/core/adapters/ after verifying no references.
- Remove package __init__.py and directory when empty.

C. Legacy module removal
- Remove src/proxy_logic.py, src/command_parser.py, src/command_processor.py, src/session.py.
- Refactor src/main.py: delete legacy endpoints; ensure src/core/cli.py is sole entry.
- Sweep imports and update references across src/.

D. Documentation and tests polish
- Re-run dead code detection; remove stragglers.
- Align docs with final paths; add troubleshooting for tool-call loop detection configuration.
- Confirm test coverage remains ≥ 90% and integration tests exercise the full pipeline (streaming + non-streaming).

E. Observability
- Validate WARNING/DEBUG logs for tool-call loop detection per spec (session, tool, repeats, ttl, truncated signature, model/backend, action, timestamp).

Definition of done (for this phase)
- All legacy code and adapters removed.
- No feature-flag branches remain.
- Tests 100% green; coverage ≥ 90%.
- Docs updated; SoT reflects final state.

## Decision log and chronology

Chronology (based on file creation times):
- 2025-08-14 23:12 – dev/tool_call_loop_detection.md: Initial design and plan for tool-call loop detection.
- 2025-08-14 23:36 – dev/milestone_refactoring_effort.md: Original milestone spec and phased refactor blueprint. Kept intact.
- 2025-08-15 13:15 – dev/refactoring_summary.md: Mid-stream summary; paints broad progress as largely complete but notes integration work remaining.
- 2025-08-16 00:53 – dev/solid_integration_plan.md: Detailed integration plan across phases (bridge → services → command → pipeline → switchover → cleanup).
- 2025-08-16 01:56 – dev/legacy_cleanup_plan.md: Post-integration cleanup plan (feature flags, adapters, legacy endpoints, dead code, docs/tests, final cleanup).
- 2025-08-16 01:57 – dev/solid_integration_complete.md: Asserts completion of SOLID integration and enumerates improvements.
- 2025-08-16 10:19 – dev/solid_integration_code_review.md: Code review identifies critical gaps (ResponseProcessor not wired; coexistence).
- 2025-08-16 10:58 – dev/legacy_cleanup_complete.md: Reports completion of planned cleanup phases with remaining suggestions.
- 2025-08-16 11:07 – dev/legacy_code_removal_plan.md: Timeline for full legacy code removal (2024-09 to 2024-12) – authoritative for physical deletion steps.
- 2025-08-16 11:07 – dev/solid_integration_final_summary.md: Confirms ResponseProcessor integration, flags hardcoded “on,” comprehensive tests, and deprecation status.

Reconciliation
- Treat "solid_integration_final_summary" as authoritative over the earlier "code_review" with respect to pipeline integration and default path behavior.
- Treat "legacy_code_removal_plan" as authoritative for the remaining timeline and concrete deletion tasks.
