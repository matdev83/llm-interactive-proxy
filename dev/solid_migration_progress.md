# SOLID Migration Progress Report

## Completed Tasks

1. **Legacy Adapter Removal**
   - ✅ Removed legacy config adapter
   - ✅ Removed legacy session adapter
   - ✅ Removed legacy command adapter
   - ✅ Removed legacy backend adapter

2. **Integration Bridge Cleanup**
   - ✅ Removed legacy initialization methods
   - ✅ Removed legacy state setup

3. **Hybrid Controller Cleanup**
   - ✅ Removed legacy flow methods
   - ✅ Simplified controller to only use new architecture

4. **Test Fixture Updates**
   - ✅ Updated legacy_client fixture to use new architecture
   - ✅ Removed legacy state initialization from tests

5. **Fixed Basic Tests**
   - ✅ Fixed phase1_integration tests
   - ✅ Fixed phase2_integration tests

## Remaining Tasks

1. **Fix Broken Tests**
   - Many integration tests still rely on legacy architecture components
   - Authentication issues in tests (401 Unauthorized)
   - Loop detection tests need to be updated
   - Tool call tests need to be updated

2. **Add Missing Tests**
   - Need to add tests for new architecture components
   - Need to add tests for removed functionality

3. **Update Documentation**
   - Update README.md to reflect new architecture
   - Update API_REFERENCE.md to reflect new architecture
   - Update ARCHITECTURE.md to reflect new architecture

4. **Final Verification**
   - Verify that all functionality is preserved
   - Verify that all tests pass
   - Verify that no legacy code remains

## Next Steps

1. Focus on fixing the broken tests, especially:
   - Authentication issues in tests
   - Loop detection tests
   - Tool call tests

2. Once tests are fixed, update documentation to reflect the new architecture.

3. Perform final verification to ensure all functionality is preserved and no legacy code remains.
