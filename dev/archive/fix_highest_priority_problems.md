PRIORITIZED FAILURE CATEGORIES

1) Async/Await Issues | ImpactScore=0.85 | Confidence=high
Root cause (concise): Missing await for async method calls causing 'coroutine' object has no attribute errors

Affected dependent code (calling → called):
•  src/core/services/request_processor.py:ResponseProcessor.process_response:443
•  src/core/app/controllers/chat_controller.py:handle_chat_completion:71
•  src/core/services/request_processor.py:_create_non_streaming_response:448

Estimated tests fixed if this category is resolved: 45

Proposed fix strategy:
- Add await keyword to async method calls in request_processor.py
- Ensure proper async/await chain throughout the request handling pipeline
