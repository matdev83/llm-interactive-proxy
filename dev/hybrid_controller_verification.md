## Status

**Status**: Updated ✅

## Actions Taken

1. Removed legacy flow methods from the hybrid controller
2. Simplified the controller to only use the new architecture
3. Verified that the controller now only depends on the new architecture components

## Verification

- ✅ No more legacy flow methods in the hybrid controller
- ✅ No linting issues in the updated file
- ✅ The controller now only uses the new architecture components

## Next Steps

1. Update test fixtures to use the new architecture components directly
2. Fix broken tests that may be affected by the removal of legacy flow methods
3. Add missing tests for the new architecture components
