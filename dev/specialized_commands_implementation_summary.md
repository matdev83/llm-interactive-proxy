# Specialized Commands Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of specialized commands that were missing from the new SOLID architecture. Based on the analysis of the legacy code and the new SOLID architecture, three key commands were identified as not fully ported:

1. **OneOff Command**: Sets a one-time override for the backend and model for the next request.
2. **PWD Command**: Shows the current project directory.
3. **Hello Command**: Returns the interactive welcome banner.

All three commands have been successfully implemented in the new SOLID architecture, following the established patterns and best practices.

## Implementation Details

### 1. OneOff Command

The OneOff command allows users to set a one-time override for the backend and model for the next request. This is useful for quickly testing a different model without changing the default settings.

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `src/core/commands/handlers/oneoff_handler.py`: Implemented the `OneOffCommandHandler` class.
- `src/core/commands/handler_factory.py`: Registered the `OneOffCommandHandler` with the command handler factory.
- `tests/unit/core/test_oneoff_command.py`: Created unit tests for the `OneOffCommandHandler`.
- `tests/integration/test_oneoff_command_integration.py`: Created integration tests for the OneOff command.
- `docs/API_REFERENCE.md`: Updated documentation to include information about the OneOff command.

**Key Features:**
- Support for both slash (`/`) and colon (`:`) syntax for specifying backend and model.
- Proper validation of backend and model parameters.
- Integration with the `BackendConfiguration` to set the one-off route.

### 2. PWD Command

The PWD command shows the current project directory, which is useful for users to know which project they are working with.

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `src/core/commands/handlers/pwd_handler.py`: Implemented the `PwdCommandHandler` class.
- `src/core/commands/handler_factory.py`: Registered the `PwdCommandHandler` with the command handler factory.
- `tests/unit/core/test_pwd_command.py`: Created unit tests for the `PwdCommandHandler`.
- `tests/integration/test_pwd_command_integration.py`: Created integration tests for the PWD command.
- `docs/API_REFERENCE.md`: Updated documentation to include information about the PWD command.

**Key Features:**
- Proper handling of cases where the project directory is not set.
- Clear error messages for users.

### 3. Hello Command

The Hello command returns the interactive welcome banner, which is useful for new users to get started with the system.

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `src/core/commands/handlers/hello_handler.py`: Implemented the `HelloCommandHandler` class.
- `src/core/commands/handler_factory.py`: Registered the `HelloCommandHandler` with the command handler factory.
- `tests/unit/core/test_hello_command.py`: Created unit tests for the `HelloCommandHandler`.
- `tests/integration/test_hello_command_integration.py`: Created integration tests for the Hello command.
- `docs/API_REFERENCE.md`: Updated documentation to include information about the Hello command.

**Key Features:**
- Sets the `hello_requested` flag in the session state, which triggers the display of the welcome banner.
- Integration with the `SessionStateBuilder` to create a new state with the flag set.

## Testing

All commands have been thoroughly tested with both unit tests and integration tests. The tests cover:

- Initialization of command handlers
- Parameter validation
- Command execution
- State updates
- Error handling

## Documentation

The API reference documentation has been updated to include information about all three commands, including:

- Command syntax
- Description
- Examples of usage
- Expected output

## Conclusion

With the implementation of these three specialized commands, all known command functionality from the legacy codebase has been successfully ported to the new SOLID architecture. The implementation follows the established patterns and best practices, ensuring consistency and maintainability.

These commands are now fully functional in the new architecture and can be used by users without any loss of functionality compared to the legacy codebase.
