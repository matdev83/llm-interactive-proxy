# Test Fixtures Verification

## Status

**Status**: Updated ✅

## Actions Taken

1. Updated the `legacy_client` fixture to be an alias for `test_client`
2. Removed the legacy state initialization from the `legacy_client` fixture
3. Verified that the fixture now only depends on the new architecture components

## Verification

- ✅ No more legacy state initialization in the test fixtures
- ✅ No linting issues in the updated file
- ✅ The fixtures now only use the new architecture components

## Next Steps

1. Fix broken tests that may be affected by the removal of legacy state initialization
2. Add missing tests for the new architecture components
3. Create a comprehensive integration test suite
