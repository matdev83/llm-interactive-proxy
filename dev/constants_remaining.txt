I've successfully implemented a comprehensive error message and validation constants system to make the test suite even more robust. Here's what was accomplished:

  1. Created Error Message Constants Module (src/core/constants/error_constants.py)- Authentication Errors: Standardized messages for API key and auth token validation errors
   - Backend Errors: Consistent error messages for backend configuration, connection, and availability issues- Command Errors: Unified error messages for command parsing, execution, and
     validation failures
   - Configuration Errors: Standardized configuration loading and validation error messages- Session Errors: Consistent session-related error messages- Model Errors: Standardized model
     discovery and availability error messages
   - Loop Detection Errors: Unified loop detection error messages
   - Tool Call Errors: Consistent tool call execution and validation error messages
   - Streaming Errors: Standardized streaming response processing error messages
   - Network Errors: Consistent network connectivity and timeout error messages
   - File System Errors: Standardized file read/write error messages
   - JSON Errors: Consistent JSON parsing and encoding error messages
   - Validation Errors: Unified validation error messages for type checking and range validation
   - Rate Limiting Errors: Standardized rate limiting and wait error messages
   - Security Errors: Consistent security validation and redaction error messages- Generic Errors: General-purpose error messages for internal errors and service unavailability

  2. Created Validation Constants Module (src/core/constants/validation_constants.py)
   - Generic Validation Messages: Standardized messages for common validation scenarios
   - Specific Validation Messages: Constants for specific validation requirements like temperature ranges, project names, etc.
   - Command Prefix Validation: Messages for command prefix validation
   - Tool Loop Validation: Constants for tool loop detection validation
   - Backend/Model Validation: Messages for backend and model validation### 3. Updated Existing Code to Use Error Constants
   - Command Handlers: Updated command_handler.py to use COMMAND_EXECUTION_ERROR constant
   - Set Handler: Updated set_handler.py to use COMMAND_PARSING_ERROR constant- Model Command: Updated model_command.py to use COMMAND_EXECUTION_ERROR constant
   - Project Command: Updated project_command.py to use COMMAND_EXECUTION_ERROR constant
   - Temperature Command: Updated temperature_command.py to use COMMAND_EXECUTION_ERROR constant
   - Backend Handlers: Updated backend_handlers.py to use appropriate error constants- Project Handler: Updated project_handler.py to use appropriate error constants
   - Loop Detection Handlers: Updated loop_detection_handlers.py to use appropriate error constants### 4. Created Comprehensive Unit Tests
   - Backend Handler Tests: Created test_unit_backend_handlers.py with comprehensive tests using error constants
   - Loop Detection Handler Tests: Created test_unit_loop_detection_handlers.py with comprehensive tests using error constants
   - Project Handler Tests: Updated test_unit_project_command.py to use error constants
   - Validation Constants Tests: Created test_validation_constants.py to verify constant functionality

  5. Verified Implementation
   - All existing unit tests continue to pass- Integration tests continue to pass (where applicable)
   - Error message constants are properly imported and used throughout the codebase- No breaking changes were introduced

  6. Benefits Achieved1. Further Reduced Test Fragility: Tests now use standardized error message formats instead of hardcoded strings
   2. Improved Maintainability: All error messages are centralized in one location, making updates easier
   3. Better Consistency: Standardized error message formats across the entire codebase
   4. Enhanced Debugging: Consistent error message structure makes debugging easier5. Reduced Duplication: Eliminated duplicate error message strings throughout the codebase

  7. Areas for Future Expansion
  While we've made significant progress in standardizing error messages and validation messages, there are still more areas that could benefit from similar improvements:1. HTTP Status
  Messages: Standardize HTTP response status messages and descriptions2. Log Message Formats: Create constants for common log message formats
   3. Configuration Error Messages: Create more specific constants for different configuration validation errors4. Network Error Messages: Expand network error constants for specific
      connection scenarios5. Database Error Messages: Standardize database-related error messages if/when database functionality is added

  The foundation is now in place to systematically address these areas and make the entire test suite even more robust against changes in error message text.All existing functionality
  continues to work as expected, with the added benefit of improved maintainability and reduced test fragility.This implementation provides a solid foundation for making the entire test
  suite more robust and maintainable, continuing the work we started with command output constants.
