# Pending issues / problems to solve

- [ ] BUG #1. I run this proxy with command `python -m src.core.cli --default-backend gemini-cli-batch --log-level DEBUG` and configure Cline to connect to it. I type something into the chat box and it sends request. It receives response 'To use gemini-cli-batch, you need to set the project-dir first. Use the !/set(project-dir=...) command to configure the Google Cloud project.'. This is good, but this response is returned in plain text, while Cline agent and its forks expect a spefific tool call to complete request. This is already implemented for some commands, check why it is not working properly.
- [ ] Bug #2. I continued the session described it BUG #1 and typed '!/set(project-dir="C:\Users\Mateusz\source\repos\portfolio-backtester")' and hit the send button. Proxy received it but instead of confirmation of the project dir now set, I received unexpected reply 'To use gemini-cli-batch, you need to set the project-dir first. Use the !/set(project-dir=...) command to configure the Google Cloud project.' again, also without the proper tool call. This time both are unexpected. Command should set the project directory session-wide. Successful command execution should get confirmed by some message generated locally by the proxy, like "project-dir set to <dir_name_here>" this also should be wrapped in a tool call (for Cline forks) otherwise output shoud be in plain text for other agents.
