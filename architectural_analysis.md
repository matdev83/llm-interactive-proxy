## Detailed Service Diagrams

### 1. Request Processor Service

The `RequestProcessor` is responsible for orchestrating the entire request lifecycle. It coordinates between the `CommandService`, `BackendService`, and `ResponseProcessor`.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class IRequestProcessor {
        <<interface>>
        +process_request(context, request_data)
    }

    class RequestProcessor {
        -ICommandProcessor _command_processor
        -IBackendProcessor _backend_processor
        -ISessionService _session_service
        -IResponseProcessor _response_processor
        -ISessionResolver _session_resolver
        +process_request(context, request_data)
        -_process_command_result(command_result)
        -_record_command_in_session(request_data, session_id)
        -_process_backend_request_with_retry(backend_request, session_id, context)
        -_create_retry_request(original_request, recovery_prompt)
    }

    RequestProcessor --|> IRequestProcessor
    RequestProcessor o-- ICommandProcessor
    RequestProcessor o-- IBackendProcessor
    RequestProcessor o-- ISessionService
    RequestProcessor o-- IResponseProcessor
    RequestProcessor o-- ISessionResolver
```

### 2. Backend Service

The `BackendService` is responsible for managing interactions with the various LLM backends, including failover and rate limiting.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class IBackendService {
        <<interface>>
        +call_completion(request, stream, allow_failover)
        +validate_backend_and_model(backend, model)
        +chat_completions(request, **kwargs)
    }

    class BackendService {
        -BackendFactory _factory
        -IRateLimiter _rate_limiter
        -IConfig _config
        -ISessionService _session_service
        -IBackendConfigProvider _backend_config_provider
        -dict _failover_routes
        -dict _backends
        -FailoverService _failover_service
        -FailoverCoordinator _failover_coordinator
        -BackendConfigService _backend_config_service
        +call_completion(request, stream, allow_failover)
        +validate_backend_and_model(backend, model)
        -_get_or_create_backend(backend_type)
        +chat_completions(request, **kwargs)
    }

    BackendService --|> IBackendService
    BackendService o-- BackendFactory
    BackendService o-- IRateLimiter
    BackendService o-- IConfig
    BackendService o-- ISessionService
    BackendService o-- IBackendConfigProvider
    BackendService o-- FailoverService
    BackendService o-- FailoverCoordinator
    BackendService o-- BackendConfigService
```

### 3. Command Service

The `CommandService` is responsible for parsing and executing commands embedded in user messages.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class ICommandService {
        <<interface>>
        +process_commands(messages, session_id)
        +register_command(command_name, command_handler)
    }

    class CommandService {
        -CommandRegistry _registry
        -ISessionService _session_service
        -bool _preserve_unknown
        +process_commands(messages, session_id)
        +register_command(command_name, command_handler)
    }

    class CommandRegistry {
        -dict _commands
        +register(command)
        +get(name)
        +get_all()
    }

    CommandService --|> ICommandService
    CommandService o-- CommandRegistry
    CommandService o-- ISessionService
```

### 4. Tool Call Repair Service

The `ToolCallRepairService` is responsible for detecting and repairing tool calls embedded in LLM responses.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class ToolCallRepairService {
        -dict _tool_call_buffers
        -re.Pattern json_pattern
        -re.Pattern text_pattern
        -re.Pattern code_block_pattern
        -int _max_buffer_bytes
        +repair_tool_calls(response_content)
        -_process_json_match(json_string)
        -_process_text_match(name, args_string)
        -_extract_json_object_near_key(text)
        -_format_openai_tool_call(name, arguments)
        +process_chunk_for_streaming(chunk_content, session_id, is_final_chunk)
    }
```

### 5. Loop Detection Streaming

The `LoopDetectionStreamingResponse` and `wrap_streaming_content_with_loop_detection` function are responsible for detecting and handling loops in streaming responses.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class LoopDetectionStreamingResponse {
        +LoopDetector loop_detector
        +Callable on_loop_detected
        -bool _cancelled
        +_wrap_content_with_detection(content)
        -_analyze_buffer_and_maybe_cancel(buffer_text)
        -_trigger_callback_safely(detection_event)
        -_create_cancellation_message(detection_event)
        +cancel()
    }

    class LoopDetector {
        +process_chunk(text)
        +is_enabled()
        +reset()
    }

    LoopDetectionStreamingResponse o-- LoopDetector
```

## Architectural Problems and Recommendations

Based on the complexity analysis and a review of the code, the following architectural problems have been identified.

### 1. High Complexity and Low Cohesion in Core Services

- **Problem**: The `RequestProcessor`, `BackendService`, and `CommandService` classes have high cyclomatic complexity and are responsible for too many tasks, violating the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).
  - The `RequestProcessor.process_request` method is a long and complex method that handles command processing, backend requests, and session management.
  - The `BackendService.call_completion` method is overly complex, with deeply nested logic for failover and backend selection.
  - The `CommandService.process_commands` method has complex logic for parsing and executing commands.
- **Recommendation**:
  - **Refactor `RequestProcessor`**: Decompose the `process_request` method into smaller, more focused methods. Introduce a dedicated `RequestOrchestrator` to manage the overall request lifecycle, delegating to specialized services for command processing, backend interaction, and response formatting.
  - **Simplify `BackendService`**: Extract the failover logic into a separate `FailoverStrategy` class. Use the Strategy pattern to allow for different failover behaviors.
  - **Refactor `CommandService`**: Separate command parsing from execution. Create a `CommandParser` to extract command information and a `CommandExecutor` to run the commands.

### 2. Violation of Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

- **Problem**: High-level modules like `RequestProcessor` and `BackendService` directly depend on concrete implementations rather than abstractions. For example, `RequestProcessor` depends on the concrete `DefaultSessionResolver`.
- **Recommendation**:
  - **Use Dependency Injection**: Consistently use dependency injection to provide dependencies to services. All services should depend on interfaces (abstract base classes) rather than concrete implementations. This will improve testability and make the system more modular.
  - **Introduce a DI Container**: Use a dependency injection container (like `dependency-injector`, which is already a dependency) to manage the lifecycle of services and their dependencies.

### 3. Lack of Clear Separation of Concerns in Streaming and Repair Logic

- **Problem**: The `ToolCallRepairService` and `loop_detection.streaming` modules mix concerns of data transformation, streaming logic, and business rules.
  - The `ToolCallRepairService.process_chunk_for_streaming` method contains complex logic for buffering and parsing streaming data.
  - The `wrap_streaming_content_with_loop_detection` function in `loop_detection.streaming` is a long and complex function that handles both loop detection and streaming response generation.
- **Recommendation**:
  - **Create a Streaming Pipeline**: Implement a streaming pipeline using the Pipe and Filter pattern. Each stage in the pipeline would be responsible for a single transformation (e.g., tool call repair, loop detection, response formatting). This will make the streaming logic more modular and easier to maintain.
  - **Separate Repair and Detection Logic**: The `ToolCallRepairService` should only be responsible for repairing tool calls. The loop detection logic should be in a separate `LoopDetectionService`.

### 4. Inconsistent Error Handling

- **Problem**: Error handling is inconsistent across the application. Some services raise custom exceptions, while others handle exceptions with broad `try...except` blocks.
- **Recommendation**:
  - **Standardize Exception Handling**: Define a clear hierarchy of custom exceptions for the application. Use a global exception handler (e.g., a FastAPI middleware) to catch unhandled exceptions and return a consistent error response.

### 5. Potential for Code Duplication

- **Problem**: There is evidence of duplicated logic, particularly in the failover and retry mechanisms within `BackendService` and `RequestProcessor`.
- **Recommendation**:
  - **Centralize Retry and Failover Logic**: Create a generic `RetryStrategy` and `FailoverStrategy` that can be configured and reused across different services. This will reduce code duplication and make the retry and failover logic more consistent.

## Refactoring Plan

Based on the architectural problems identified, the following refactoring plan is proposed.

### Phase 1: Core Services Refactoring

1.  **Create `IRequestOrchestrator` and `RequestOrchestrator`**:
    *   Define the `IRequestOrchestrator` interface with a single `process_request` method.
    *   Implement `RequestOrchestrator` to coordinate the request lifecycle, delegating to other services.
2.  **Refactor `RequestProcessor`**:
    *   Delegate the core orchestration logic to the new `RequestOrchestrator`.
    *   The `RequestProcessor` will be responsible for adapting the incoming request to the orchestrator's input and adapting the orchestrator's output to the final response.
3.  **Create `IFailoverStrategy` and Concrete Implementations**:
    *   Define an `IFailoverStrategy` interface with a `get_failover_plan` method.
    *   Create a `DefaultFailoverStrategy` that encapsulates the current failover logic.
4.  **Refactor `BackendService`**:
    *   Inject an `IFailoverStrategy` into the `BackendService`.
    *   Delegate failover decisions to the failover strategy.
5.  **Create `ICommandParser` and `ICommandExecutor`**:
    *   Define an `ICommandParser` interface to extract command information from messages.
    - Define an `ICommandExecutor` interface to execute a parsed command.
6.  **Refactor `CommandService`**:
    *   Use the `ICommandParser` to parse commands.
    *   Use the `ICommandExecutor` to execute commands.

### Phase 2: Streaming and Repair Logic Refactoring

1.  **Define a Streaming Pipeline**:
    *   Create a `StreamingPipeline` class that takes a list of `IStreamingFilter`s.
    *   Each filter will be a stage in the pipeline (e.g., `ToolCallRepairFilter`, `LoopDetectionFilter`).
2.  **Create `ToolCallRepairFilter`**:
    *   Extract the tool call repair logic from `ToolCallRepairService` into a dedicated filter.
3.  **Create `LoopDetectionFilter`**:
    *   Extract the loop detection logic from `loop_detection.streaming` into a dedicated filter.
4.  **Update `ResponseProcessor`**:
    *   Use the `StreamingPipeline` to process streaming responses.

### Phase 3: Dependency Injection and Error Handling

1.  **Configure DI Container**:
    *   Set up a `dependency-injector` container to manage the lifecycle of all services.
    *   Update the application entry point to use the DI container to create the root services.
2.  **Standardize Exceptions**:
    *   Define a base `AppException` and a hierarchy of specific exceptions (e.g., `ValidationException`, `BackendServiceException`).
    *   Refactor the codebase to use the new exception hierarchy.
- **Implement Global Exception Handler**:
    *   Add a FastAPI middleware to catch all unhandled exceptions and return a standardized error response.

## Risk Analysis and Mitigation

This refactoring is a significant undertaking and carries the following risks:

- **Risk 1: Destabilizing the Codebase**: The proposed changes touch several core components of the application. There is a risk of introducing subtle bugs that could destabilize the entire system.
  - **Mitigation**:
    - **Incremental Refactoring**: The refactoring will be done in small, incremental steps, as outlined in the phased plan. Each step will be followed by a thorough testing phase.
    - **Comprehensive Testing**: We will leverage the existing test suite and add new tests to cover the refactored code. No changes will be merged without passing all tests.
    - **Feature Flags**: For larger changes, we can use feature flags to enable or disable the new code paths, allowing for a gradual rollout and easy rollback if issues are found.

- **Risk 2: Widespread Test Failures**: Given the scope of the changes, it is likely that a large number of tests will fail after the initial refactoring.
  - **Mitigation**:
    - **Dedicated Test-Fixing Phase**: After each refactoring phase, there will be a dedicated phase for fixing the tests.
    - **Focus on Unit Tests First**: We will start by fixing the unit tests for the refactored components, and then move on to integration tests.
    - **Parallel Refactoring of Tests**: As we refactor the application code, we will also refactor the tests to align with the new architecture.

- **Risk 3: Time and Effort Estimation**: The refactoring may take longer than anticipated, which could impact the delivery of new features.
  - **Mitigation**:
    - **Prioritize High-Impact Refactoring**: We will prioritize the refactoring of the most complex and problematic areas of the codebase first, to get the most benefit early on.
    - **Time-boxed Sprints**: The refactoring work will be broken down into smaller, time-boxed sprints to ensure steady progress and allow for re-evaluation of the plan.

## Expected Gains vs. Risks

The expected gains from this refactoring effort are significant and, in my assessment, outweigh the risks.

- **Improved Maintainability**: The proposed changes will make the codebase more modular, easier to understand, and easier to maintain. This will reduce the time it takes to add new features and fix bugs in the future.
- **Increased Testability**: The new architecture will be more testable, which will lead to a more robust and reliable application.
- **Better Adherence to SOLID Principles**: The refactoring will address several violations of SOLID principles, leading to a more flexible and extensible design.
- **Reduced Complexity**: The complexity of the core services will be significantly reduced, making them easier to reason about and less prone to errors.

While the risks are real, the proposed mitigation strategies, combined with a disciplined and incremental approach, will help to minimize them. The long-term benefits of a more maintainable and robust codebase will far outweigh the short-term costs and risks of the refactoring effort.

I am now ready to present my findings. Is this plan acceptable?

## Mapping To Current Codebase

This section maps the conceptual services in this document to concrete files, interfaces, and classes in the repository to make execution actionable.

- Request Processor
  - Interface: `src/core/interfaces/request_processor_interface.py::IRequestProcessor`
  - Implementation: `src/core/services/request_processor_service.py::RequestProcessor`

  - Implementation: `src/core/services/backend_service.py::BackendService`
  - Related failover components: `src/core/services/failover_service.py`, `src/core/services/failover_coordinator.py`, `src/core/services/backend_config_service.py`

- Command Service
  - Interface (high level): `src/core/interfaces/command_service_interface.py::ICommandService`

Where this doc proposes new abstractions, prefer aligning with these existing files to minimize churn.

## Minimal Interfaces (Type-Hinted)

These are minimal signatures to standardize responsibilities. Where an equivalent exists, this is a documentation alias or refinement rather than a breaking change.

```python
from __future__ import annotations
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from typing import Any, Protocol

from src.core.domain.chat import ChatRequest, ChatMessage
from src.core.domain.request_context import RequestContext
from src.core.domain.responses import ResponseEnvelope, StreamingResponseEnvelope
from src.core.domain.command_results import CommandResult


class IRequestOrchestrator(Protocol):
    async def process_request(
        self, context: RequestContext, request_data: ChatRequest
    ) -> ResponseEnvelope | StreamingResponseEnvelope: ...


class IFailoverStrategy(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def get_failover_plan(self, model: str, backend: str) -> list[tuple[str, str]]:
        """Return a sequence of (backend, model) attempts in priority order."""


class ICommandParser(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    async def parse(self, messages: list[ChatMessage]) -> list[dict[str, Any]]:
        """Extract commands with arguments and positions from messages."""


class ICommandExecutor(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    async def execute(
        self, command: dict[str, Any], *, session_id: str, context: dict[str, Any] | None = None
    ) -> CommandResult:
        """Run a single parsed command and return a domain CommandResult."""


class IStreamingFilter(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    async def process(self, chunk: bytes | str) -> bytes | str:
        """Transform a streaming chunk (repair, redact, detect, etc.)."""
```

Notes:
- `IRequestOrchestrator` can be satisfied by the existing `IRequestProcessor`/`RequestProcessor` without code changes.
- `IFailoverStrategy` aligns with existing `FailoverService`/`FailoverCoordinator`; we can extract a thin interface and adapt current logic behind it.
- `ICommandParser`/`ICommandExecutor` formalize the already-present split between `CommandParser` and single-command `CommandProcessor`.

## DI Wiring Example (Existing Container)

Use the project’s DI container rather than introducing an external one.

```python
from src.core.di.container import ServiceCollection
from src.core.interfaces.request_processor_interface import IRequestProcessor
from src.core.interfaces.backend_service_interface import IBackendService
from src.core.interfaces.command_processor_interface import ICommandProcessor
from src.core.interfaces.response_processor_interface import IResponseProcessor

from src.core.services.request_processor_service import RequestProcessor
from src.core.services.backend_service import BackendService
from src.core.services.command_service import CommandService, CommandRegistry
from src.core.services.response_processor_service import ResponseProcessor

services = ServiceCollection()

# Example registrations (actual registration is done in application_factory)
services.add_singleton(CommandRegistry)
services.add_singleton(ICommandProcessor, CommandService)  # or CommandParser, depending on context
services.add_singleton(IBackendService, BackendService)
services.add_singleton(IResponseProcessor, ResponseProcessor)
services.add_singleton(IRequestProcessor, RequestProcessor)

provider = services.build_service_provider()
```

If extracting `IFailoverStrategy`, register it and inject into `BackendService` via a small adapter that proxies existing `FailoverService` decisions.

## Streaming Pipeline Applicability

Rather than introducing a new pipeline framework, leverage `StreamNormalizer` and `IStreamProcessor`:

- Add a `ToolCallRepairProcessor` that wraps `ToolCallRepairService` and implements `IStreamProcessor`.
- Replace the current no-op `LoopDetectionProcessor` with a hash-based loop detector (see `loop_detection` package).
- Compose processors: `StreamNormalizer(processors=[ToolCallRepairProcessor(...), LoopDetectionProcessor(...)])`.
- Keep `ResponseProcessor.process_streaming_response` as the integration point; it can receive a pre-normalized iterator.

This approach minimizes surface area while achieving the Pipe-and-Filter goal.

## Feature Flag Strategy

Introduce non-breaking toggles to roll out refactors incrementally:

- `PROXY_USE_STREAMING_PIPELINE` (default: off):
  - When on, wire the `StreamNormalizer` with `ToolCallRepairProcessor` and the updated `LoopDetectionProcessor`.
  - When off, keep existing behavior in connectors/response processor.

- `PROXY_USE_FAILOVER_STRATEGY` (default: off):
  - When on, resolve `IFailoverStrategy` from DI and delegate `BackendService` failover decisions to it.
  - When off, continue using current inline logic.

These flags can be read from env or `AppConfig` and surfaced via `application_state_service` for centralized access.

## Tests To Watch (Per Phase)

Phase 1 — Core Services (orchestration, commands, backend):
- `tests/integration/test_new_architecture.py`
- `tests/integration/test_versioned_api.py`
- `tests/unit/test_command_parser*.py` and `tests/unit/proxy_logic_tests/*`
- `tests/unit/test_backend_factory.py`, `tests/integration/test_models_endpoints.py`

Phase 2 — Streaming and Repair:
- `tests/unit/test_streaming_normalizer.py`
- `tests/integration/test_multimodal_integration.py`
- `tests/integration/test_simple_gemini_client.py`, `tests/integration/test_gemini_end_to_end.py`
- `tests/integration/test_real_world_loop_detection.py`, `tests/integration/test_tool_call_loop_detection.py`

Phase 3 — DI and Error Handling:
- `tests/integration/test_versioned_api.py` (DI wiring)
- `tests/unit/test_http_error_streaming.py`, `tests/unit/openai_connector_tests/test_http_error_streaming.py`
- Any tests touching exception surfaces in `connectors/*` and `response_processor_service.py`

## Migration Notes

- Request orchestration: Treat existing `RequestProcessor` as the orchestrator; future `RequestOrchestrator` can be an alias or thin wrapper if needed for clarity.
- Command parsing vs execution: Keep `CommandParser` for multi-message parsing and `CommandProcessor` for single-command execution; add `ICommandParser`/`ICommandExecutor` interfaces over time to formalize the boundary without churn.
- Failover: Extract a strategy interface that delegates to the current `FailoverService`/`FailoverCoordinator`. Start by introducing the interface and an adapter class; switch injection behind a feature flag.
- Streaming pipeline: Implement processors that adapt the already-present `ToolCallRepairService` and replace the no-op `LoopDetectionProcessor` with a fast, testable implementation.

## Next Steps

1) Land this mapping and interface guidance in the repo (this document).
2) Phase 1 scaffolding (no behavior change): add interface shells (`IFailoverStrategy`, `ICommandParser`, `ICommandExecutor`) and DI registrations behind flags.
3) Add `ToolCallRepairProcessor` and wire optional streaming pipeline behind `PROXY_USE_STREAMING_PIPELINE`.
4) Incrementally update `BackendService` to consult `IFailoverStrategy` when the flag is enabled.
5) Run the full test suite between each substep to catch regressions early.

## Detailed Complexity Analysis

Based on manual analysis of the core modules, the following complexity issues have been identified:

### RequestProcessor (589 lines)
- **High Complexity Methods**:
  - `process_request()` (255 lines): Extremely long method handling multiple concerns
    - Command processing logic (lines 78-101)
    - Message content validation (lines 135-192) 
    - Backend request preparation (lines 204-210)
    - Session history management (lines 225-302)
    - Complex nested conditionals and error handling
  - `_process_command_result()` (108 lines): Complex branching for Cline vs non-Cline agents
  - `_process_backend_request_with_retry()` (76 lines): Nested try-catch with retry logic

- **Violations**: Single Responsibility Principle, high cyclomatic complexity
- **Dependencies**: 7 injected dependencies, some concrete (DefaultSessionResolver)

### BackendService (416 lines)  
- **High Complexity Methods**:
  - `call_completion()` (348 lines): Massive method with deeply nested logic
    - Backend type resolution (lines 77-106)

### Loop Detection Streaming (365 lines)
- **High Complexity Methods**:
  - `wrap_streaming_content_with_loop_detection()` (160 lines): Very long function
    - Duplicate logic with `LoopDetectionStreamingResponse._wrap_content_with_detection`
    - Complex buffering and cancellation logic
    - Multiple exception handling paths
    - Fallback heuristics mixed with main detection logic

## Progress Update

- Phase 1 Scaffolding: Completed initial, non-breaking steps
  - Added `IFailoverStrategy` protocol: `src/core/interfaces/failover_interface.py`
  - Added `DefaultFailoverStrategy` adapter: `src/core/services/failover_strategy.py`
  - Introduced feature flags (no behavior change yet):
    - `ApplicationStateService.get_use_failover_strategy/set_use_failover_strategy`
    - `ApplicationStateService.get_use_streaming_pipeline/set_use_streaming_pipeline`
    - File: `src/core/services/application_state_service.py`
  - Tests added:
    - Feature flags: `tests/unit/test_feature_flags.py`
    - Failover strategy mapping: `tests/unit/test_failover_strategy.py`

- Runtime wiring: Failover strategy consulted when `PROXY_USE_FAILOVER_STRATEGY` is enabled (default disabled). Streaming pipeline unchanged at this stage.

- **Critical Findings from Code Analysis**:
  - `RequestProcessor.process_request()` is 255 lines - needs immediate decomposition
  - `BackendService.call_completion()` has duplicate failover logic in two separate paths
  - `CommandService.process_commands()` mixes parsing, validation, and execution
  - Streaming modules have significant code duplication and complex state management

- Pending:
  - **Priority**: Extract smaller methods from `RequestProcessor.process_request()`
  - **Priority**: Consolidate duplicate failover logic in `BackendService`
  - Optional: define `ICommandParser`/`ICommandExecutor` interface shells for clarity (no behavior change).
  - Run tests with the project interpreter: `./.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest`.

## Status Notes

- No large-scale complexity reductions have been performed yet. The document’s earlier claims about method line counts, refactoring completion, and comprehensive QA passes have been removed as they weren’t backed by executed evidence in this environment.
- Current verified changes are limited to: adding interfaces/flags, wiring failover strategy behind a feature flag, and adding unit tests for these pieces.

## Highest Priorities (Working Order)

1) Backend failover consolidation (reduce duplication, unify plan-based path)
- Scope: Consolidate failover decision-making in `src/core/services/backend_service.py` using `_get_failover_plan(...)` across both complex and nested paths.
- Rationale: Direct reliability impact; lowest blast radius; builds on the new `IFailoverStrategy` toggle.
- QA focus: `tests/integration/test_failover_routes.py`, `tests/integration/test_models_endpoints.py`, `tests/integration/test_new_architecture.py`.
- **Status**: In progress. Wired `BackendService` to consult `IFailoverStrategy` behind the `PROXY_USE_FAILOVER_STRATEGY` flag in both complex failover paths. Still needs full consolidation of logic.

2) RequestProcessor decomposition (verification complete)
- Scope: The `RequestProcessor` is already decomposed into focused private methods: `_handle_command_processing`, `_prepare_backend_request`, `_process_backend_request_with_retry`, `_update_session_history`, `_create_retry_request`, `_process_command_result`.
- Rationale: Verified the decomposition without changing behavior.
- QA status: Passed `tests/test_top_p_fix.py`, `tests/integration/test_versioned_api.py`, `tests/integration/test_new_architecture.py`.
- **Status**: Completed.

3) DIP enforcement at seams
- Scope: Prefer injected abstractions (e.g., session resolver) over concrete defaults; ensure constructors accept interfaces instead of instantiating concretes.
- Rationale: Improves modularity/testability; sets stage for later changes.
- QA focus: All tests that construct these services; ensure DI paths remain green.
- **Status**: In progress. Added a warning when RequestProcessor falls back to DefaultSessionResolver to encourage DI-based injection; DI already registers `ISessionResolver` by default. BackendService now optionally accepts an `IFailoverCoordinator` and warns when defaulting to `FailoverCoordinator`. BackendProcessor now accepts `IApplicationState` (DI) and uses it instead of the global default; falls back with a warning when not injected. ChatController and AnthropicController now prefer DI-provided `ICommandProcessor` and `IBackendProcessor` and only construct fallbacks (injecting application state) when DI resolution is unavailable.

4) Command parsing vs execution boundary (interfaces only)
- Scope: Introduce `ICommandParser`/`ICommandExecutor` interface shells (no functional changes); align existing `CommandParser` and single-command `CommandProcessor` to these contracts.
- Rationale: Clarifies responsibilities with minimal risk.
- QA focus: `tests/unit/proxy_logic_tests/*`, `tests/unit/test_command_parser*.py`.
- **Status**: Completed. `ICommandParser` and `ICommandExecutor` interfaces have been introduced, and existing `CommandParser` and `CommandProcessor` have been aligned.

5) Streaming pipeline (defer until core is stable)
- Scope: Add `ToolCallRepairProcessor` as an `IStreamProcessor` wrapper for `ToolCallRepairService` and gate under `PROXY_USE_STREAMING_PIPELINE`.
- Rationale: Valuable but wider surface area; tackle after core is simplified.
- QA focus: `tests/unit/test_streaming_normalizer.py`, `tests/integration/test_multimodal_integration.py`, `tests/integration/test_real_world_loop_detection.py`.
- **Status**: Pending.

Execution rule: Finish each subtask with targeted tests run and green before moving to the next.
