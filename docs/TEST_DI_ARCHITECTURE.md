# Testing with Dependency Injection Architecture

This guide explains how to write and update tests to work with the new dependency injection (DI) architecture for commands in the proxy.

## Overview of Changes

The command system has been refactored to use proper dependency injection:

1. Commands requiring state access are now created via DI
2. The `CommandParser` now gets commands from the DI container's `CommandRegistry`
3. Runtime validation is enforced to prevent direct instantiation of commands that require dependencies
4. Legacy command implementations have been removed

## Testing Strategies

### Integration Tests

For integration tests, use the `setup_test_command_registry()` helper in `conftest.py`:

```python
from tests.conftest import setup_test_command_registry

def test_my_command_functionality():
    # Set up the DI command registry with mock dependencies
    registry = setup_test_command_registry()
    
    # The registry now contains all commands with appropriate mock dependencies
    # Use it to test command functionality
    command = registry.get_command("my-command")
    result = await command.execute(args, session, context)
```

### Unit Tests for `CommandParser`

When unit testing the `CommandParser` directly, be aware that:

1. The `CommandParser` will attempt to get commands from the DI container
2. If running in a test environment without a full DI setup, it will fall back to mock commands
3. These mock commands do not fully replicate all real command behaviors

For command parsing tests, use the mock commands from `tests/unit/mock_commands.py`:

```python
from src.command_parser import CommandParser
from tests.unit.mock_commands import get_mock_commands

def test_parsing_behavior():
    mock_commands = get_mock_commands()
    # Create command parser with mock commands
```

### Snapshot Testing

When updating snapshot tests for commands:

1. Run tests with `UPDATE_SNAPSHOTS=true` environment variable
2. Verify the new snapshots match the expected behavior of the DI-based commands
3. Be aware that command output format may have changed with the DI implementation

```bash
set UPDATE_SNAPSHOTS=true && python -m pytest tests/integration/commands/
```

### Skipped Tests

Several tests have been temporarily skipped with:

```python
@pytest.mark.skip("Skipping until command handling in tests is fixed")
```

These tests expect specific behavior from the legacy command system and need to be updated to:

1. Work with the new DI command architecture
2. Handle the bridge between `CommandParser` and `CommandRegistry`
3. Properly set up commands with mock dependencies

## Updating Skipped Tests

To update the skipped tests:

1. Set up proper mocking for the `CommandRegistry` 
2. Create a test helper to properly set up DI for command tests
3. Update assertions to match the behavior of DI-based commands

Example approach:

```python
def setup_command_test_environment():
    """Set up DI environment for command unit tests."""
    # Create and register commands with mock dependencies
    registry = CommandRegistry()
    state_reader_mock = Mock(spec=ISecureStateAccess)
    state_modifier_mock = Mock(spec=ISecureStateModification)
    
    # Register commands that will be tested
    registry.register(SetCommand(state_reader_mock, state_modifier_mock))
    
    # Set as global instance so CommandParser can find it
    CommandRegistry.set_instance(registry)
    return registry, state_reader_mock, state_modifier_mock
```

## Known Issues

1. The mock command implementations used for unit tests do not currently strip command text from messages
2. Some authentication tests are failing due to changes in error message format
3. The Qwen OAuth connector tests have errors unrelated to DI changes

## Future Improvements

1. Implement proper command stripping behavior in mock commands
2. Refactor remaining test failures to align with DI pattern
3. Create more comprehensive test helpers for command testing
4. Remove the skipped tests that can't be fixed
