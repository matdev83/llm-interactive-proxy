# Proxy Readiness Review

This document summarizes whether `llm-interactive-proxy` is ready for evaluation with agent tools such as Cline (VSCode extension).

## Overview

The project implements an OpenAI‑compatible HTTP API built with FastAPI. Requests to `/v1/chat/completions` and `/v1/models` are forwarded to configured backends (OpenRouter.ai or Google Gemini). The proxy parses embedded commands within chat messages and can adjust behaviour at runtime (e.g. change model, backend, failover routes, interactive mode).

Automated tests cover command processing, request forwarding, rate limiting, failover logic and connector behaviours. All tests currently pass.

## Confirmed Features

- **OpenAI API compatibility** for chat completions and model listing.
- **Streaming and non‑streaming** response forwarding for both OpenRouter and Gemini backends.
- **Multimodal message support**, including text and image parts.
- **Session history** tracking via `X-Session-ID` header.
- **Proxy commands** (`!/set`, `!/unset`, failover route commands, etc.) that modify proxy state and return confirmation messages.
- **Aggregated model listing** from all functional backends.
- **Environment/CLI configuration** of backend URLs, API keys, and command prefix.

## Limitations

- Session and failover route data are stored in memory only; persistence or production‑grade authentication is not implemented.
- The proxy assumes valid API keys are supplied via environment variables or CLI.

## Conclusion

The repository provides the required functionality to act as a custom OpenAI backend for agent tools. By pointing your agent to the proxy's `/v1` endpoint (e.g. `http://localhost:8000/v1`) you can send standard chat requests, including images, and issue proxy commands directly in the chat to modify behaviour. The project appears ready for real‑world testing.
