# Implementation and Testing Plan

## 1. Define Canonical Internal Request/Response Models

The first step is to define the canonical internal request and response models. These models will be used throughout the application, and will serve as the single source of truth for all data.

*   **Task:** Define the `CanonicalChatRequest` and `CanonicalChatResponse` models in `src/core/domain/chat.py`.
*   **Effort:** 2 hours

## 2. Implement the Centralized Translation Service

The next step is to implement the centralized translation service. This service will be responsible for all cross-API conversions, ensuring a consistent and reliable translation layer.

*   **Task:** Implement the `TranslationService` in `src/core/services/translation_service.py`.
*   **Effort:** 8 hours

## 3. Implement Anthropic-to-Domain Converters

The next step is to implement the Anthropic-to-Domain converters. These converters will be responsible for translating data from the Anthropic API to the internal domain models.

*   **Task:** Implement the `anthropic_to_domain_request` and `anthropic_to_domain_response` converters in the `TranslationService`.
*   **Effort:** 4 hours

## 4. Implement Gemini-to-Domain Converters

The next step is to implement the Gemini-to-Domain converters. These converters will be responsible for translating data from the Gemini API to the internal domain models.

*   **Task:** Implement the `gemini_to_domain_request` and `gemini_to_domain_response` converters in the `TranslationService`.
*   **Effort:** 4 hours

## 5. Refactor Existing Connectors to Use the New Service

The next step is to refactor the existing connectors to use the new centralized translation service. This will ensure that all data is translated in a consistent and reliable manner.

*   **Task:** Refactor the `AnthropicBackend`, `GeminiBackend`, and `OpenAIBackend` connectors to use the `TranslationService`.
*   **Effort:** 6 hours

## 6. Outline a Comprehensive Testing Strategy

The final step is to outline a comprehensive testing strategy. This will ensure that the new centralized translation service is working as expected, and that it is able to handle a wide range of data formats.

*   **Task:** Create a new `tests/translation` directory and add unit and integration tests for the `TranslationService`.
*   **Effort:** 8 hours

## 7. Final Plan

I have analyzed the codebase and created a detailed plan to address the shortcomings of the current cross-API translation layer. The new centralized translation service will provide a more reliable, extensible, and maintainable solution.

I am confident that this plan will address all of the issues that have been raised, and I am ready to proceed with the implementation.
