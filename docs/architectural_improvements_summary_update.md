# Architectural Improvements Summary Update

## Recent Accomplishments

### Test Migration to Proper DI

- ✅ Refactored authentication tests to use proper DI
- ✅ Refactored CLI tests to use proper DI
- ✅ Verified all tests pass with the new DI approach

### Compatibility Layer Removal

- ✅ Removed deprecated methods from `ApplicationTestBuilder`:
  - `_initialize_services`
  - `_initialize_backends`
- ✅ Removed `BackendException` alias from `backend_service.py`
- ✅ Verified all tests pass after removing these compatibility layers

### Enhanced Architectural Enforcement

- ✅ Enhanced architectural linter to detect more violations:
  - Singleton pattern usage
  - Direct imports from implementation modules instead of interfaces
  - Static method usage in service classes
- ✅ Updated pre-commit hook to use enhanced architectural linter
- ✅ Made pre-commit hook mandatory for all contributors
- ✅ Added CI checks that enforce architectural patterns via GitHub Actions

## Current Status

All tests are passing with the architectural improvements in place. The codebase is now more aligned with SOLID principles and proper dependency injection practices.

## Next Steps

### Continue Test Migration

- Continue refactoring tests to use proper DI instead of direct app.state access
- Focus on high-impact test files first (those with the most app.state accesses)
- Use the test_di_utils.py utilities consistently across all tests

### Remove Remaining Compatibility Layers

- Continue removing deprecated methods and compatibility layers from the list
- Update any code that might still depend on these methods
- Verify that all tests pass after each removal

### Enforce Stricter Architectural Boundaries

- Continue improving the architectural linter to detect more violations
- Consider adding more checks to the CI workflow
- Provide documentation and examples for developers on proper architectural patterns
