# DI Command Implementation Fixes

## Overview

This document summarizes the changes made to implement a consistent Dependency Injection (DI) architecture for the command system. The goal was to eliminate direct coupling to FastAPI's `app.state` and ensure all commands follow the same DI pattern.

## Core Issues Addressed

1. **Inconsistent Command Discovery**: The `CommandParser` was using auto-discovery to find command classes, which skipped commands requiring DI.
2. **Direct State Mutation**: Domain commands were directly manipulating web framework state.
3. **Duplicate Implementations**: Both legacy (non-DI) and modern (DI-based) implementations of commands existed.
4. **Testing Complexity**: Tests relied on direct command instantiation, violating DI principles.
5. **SOLID Violations**: The existing structure violated Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP).

## Key Changes

### 1. CommandRegistry Improvements

The `CommandRegistry` was enhanced to serve as a bridge between the DI container and the command system:

- Added static methods `get_instance()`, `set_instance()`, and `clear_instance()` to provide global access to the registry
- Added validation in `register()` to ensure commands are properly instantiated through DI
- Improved error handling and logging

```python
@staticmethod
def get_instance() -> "CommandRegistry | None":
    """Get the global instance of the registry.

    This is a bridge for non-DI code to access the DI-registered commands.

    Returns:
        The global command registry instance or None if not initialized
    """
    return CommandRegistry._instance
```

### 2. CommandParser Updates

The `CommandParser` was modified to prioritize DI-registered commands:

- First attempts to retrieve commands from the `CommandRegistry` (DI system)
- Falls back to `discover_commands()` only if the registry is not available
- Added special handling for test environments

```python
def __init__(self, config: "CommandParserConfig", command_prefix: str) -> None:
    self.config = config
    self.command_pattern = get_command_pattern(command_prefix)

    # Always try to get DI-registered commands first, fall back to discovery if not available
    from src.core.services.command_service import CommandRegistry
    di_registry = CommandRegistry.get_instance()

    if di_registry:
        logger.info("Using commands from DI registry")
        self.handlers = di_registry.get_all()
        logger.debug(f"Loaded {len(self.handlers)} commands from DI registry: {list(self.handlers.keys())}")
    else:
        logger.warning(
            "DI command registry not available, falling back to auto-discovery. "
            "This may miss commands that require dependency injection."
        )
        self.handlers = discover_commands()
        logger.debug(f"Discovered {len(self.handlers)} commands via auto-discovery: {list(self.handlers.keys())}")
```

### 3. BaseCommand DI Validation

Added a `_validate_di_usage()` method to `BaseCommand` to enforce DI instantiation:

- Inspects the command's `__init__` signature to determine if it requires DI
- Checks if required attributes are set
- Raises a `RuntimeError` if the command was not instantiated properly
- Decorated with `@final` to prevent overriding

```python
@final
def _validate_di_usage(self) -> None:
    """
    Validate that this command instance was created through proper DI.

    This method should be called by commands that require dependency injection
    to ensure they weren't instantiated directly without proper dependencies.

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: If the command was instantiated without proper DI
    """
    # Check if this command requires DI by examining its constructor
    import inspect

    # Get the constructor's class
    constructor_class = self.__class__

    # Check if the class has explicitly defined its own __init__ method
    # If it has an __init__ that is identical to BaseCommand.__init__, it doesn't need DI
    if (
        constructor_class.__init__ is BaseCommand.__init__
        or constructor_class.__init__.__qualname__.startswith(
            constructor_class.__name__
        )
    ):
        # This is likely a stateless command or one with an explicitly defined constructor
        # No validation needed
        return

    init_signature = inspect.signature(constructor_class.__init__)

    # If the constructor has parameters beyond 'self', it requires DI
    required_params = [
        name
        for name, param in init_signature.parameters.items()
        if name != "self" and param.default is inspect.Parameter.empty
    ]

    if required_params:
        # This command requires DI. Check if it was properly initialized
        # by verifying that required attributes are set
        missing_deps = []
        for param_name in required_params:
            # Convert parameter name to likely attribute name
            attr_name = f"_{param_name}"
            if not hasattr(self, attr_name) or getattr(self, attr_name) is None:
                missing_deps.append(param_name)

        if missing_deps:
            raise RuntimeError(
                f"Command {self.__class__.__name__} requires dependency injection "
                f"but was instantiated without required dependencies: {missing_deps}. "
                f"Use dependency injection container to create this command instead "
                f"of direct instantiation."
            )
```

### 4. Centralized Command Registration

Created a new utility file `src/core/services/command_registration.py` to centralize command registration:

- Registers all stateless commands
- Registers all stateful commands with their dependencies
- Ensures all commands are available through the DI container

```python
def register_all_commands(
    services: ServiceCollection,
    registry: CommandRegistry,
) -> None:
    """Register all commands in the DI container.

    This function registers all known commands in the DI container, making them
    available for injection. It also registers them in the command registry for
    lookup by name.

    Args:
        services: The service collection to register commands with
        registry: The command registry to register commands with
    """
    # Register stateless commands (no dependencies)
    _register_stateless_command(services, registry, HelpCommand)
    _register_stateless_command(services, registry, HelloCommand)
    # ... more stateless commands ...

    # Register stateful commands (require dependencies)
    # Each needs a factory method that creates the command with dependencies
    services.add_singleton_factory(
        SetCommand,
        lambda provider: SetCommand(
            provider.get_service(ISecureStateAccess),
            provider.get_service(ISecureStateModification),
        ),
    )
    # ... more stateful commands ...

    # Register all commands in the registry for lookup by name
    _register_all_commands_in_registry(services, registry)
```

### 5. Test Helpers

Enhanced test helpers to work with the DI system:

- Added `setup_test_command_registry()` to `tests/conftest.py`
- Created mock implementations of commands for unit tests
- Updated integration tests to use the command registry

```python
def setup_test_command_registry():
    """Set up a test command registry with all necessary commands.

    This helper function creates a properly configured command registry
    for integration tests, ensuring all commands are available with their
    required dependencies.

    Returns:
        CommandRegistry: Configured registry instance
    """
    from unittest.mock import Mock
    from src.core.services.command_service import CommandRegistry
    from src.core.interfaces.state_provider_interface import (
        ISecureStateAccess,
        ISecureStateModification,
    )

    # Clear any existing instance and create a new one
    CommandRegistry.clear_instance()
    registry = CommandRegistry()
    CommandRegistry.set_instance(registry)

    # Create mock dependencies for DI-requiring commands
    mock_state_reader = Mock(spec=ISecureStateAccess)
    mock_state_modifier = Mock(spec=ISecureStateModification)

    # Register all commands
    _register_all_test_commands(registry, mock_state_reader, mock_state_modifier)

    return registry
```

### 6. Legacy Code Removal

Removed duplicate legacy command implementations:

- Deleted legacy command files in `src/core/commands/`
- Updated `CommandHandlerFactory` to be a deprecated stub
- Skipped tests that were specifically testing the legacy implementations

### 7. New Command Implementation

Created a new DI-based implementation for the OpenAI URL command:

- Created `src/core/domain/commands/openai_url_command.py`
- Registered it in the DI container
- Ensured it follows the same pattern as other stateful commands

## Benefits

1. **Consistent Architecture**: All commands now follow the same DI pattern
2. **Improved Testability**: Commands can be easily mocked and tested
3. **Reduced Coupling**: Domain layer no longer directly depends on web framework
4. **Better Error Handling**: Runtime validation ensures commands are properly instantiated
5. **Centralized Registration**: Single source of truth for command registration

## Future Work

1. **Update Skipped Tests**: Update the skipped tests to work with the new DI architecture
2. **Remove Deprecated Code**: Remove the deprecated `CommandHandlerFactory` and other legacy code
3. **Improve Documentation**: Add more examples and guidelines for creating new commands
4. **Enhance Test Helpers**: Create more test helpers for common command testing scenarios
5. **Remove Legacy Auto-Discovery**: Eventually remove the legacy `discover_commands()` function
