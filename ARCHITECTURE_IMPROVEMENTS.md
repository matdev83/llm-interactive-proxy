# Architecture Improvements

This document summarizes the architectural improvements made to address issues with the SOLID and DIP principles in the codebase.

## Problems Identified

1. **Mixed Config Shapes**: `backend_configs` was passed with inconsistent types (dict vs BackendSettings/BackendConfig), causing branching logic in `_get_or_create_backend`.
2. **Tight Coupling and Duplicated Factory Logic**: `ApplicationBuilder` constructed `BackendFactory` both via DI and ad-hoc fallbacks; backend initialization happened in multiple places with slightly different assumptions.
3. **Ambiguous Ownership**: App state vs DI container - unclear which was the source of truth for configuration and services.
4. **Complex and Error-Prone Structure**: Overly complicated parameters with multiple typing options made the code hard to maintain.
5. **Fragile Process of App Setup**: Building all objects and configuring them was error-prone and difficult to debug.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Consistent Configuration Access

- Created `IBackendConfigProvider` interface to provide canonical access to backend configurations
- Implemented `BackendConfigProvider` adapter to normalize config shapes (dict vs BackendConfig)
- Registered the provider in DI to make it available throughout the application
- Updated `BackendService` to use the provider instead of directly accessing config

### 2. Centralized Backend Initialization

- Moved backend initialization logic into `BackendFactory.ensure_backend()`
- Provided typed parameters to improve type safety
- Eliminated duplicate initialization logic

### 3. Single Source of Truth for Resources

- Ensured a single `httpx.AsyncClient` is registered in DI and used everywhere
- Stored the client on app.state for proper shutdown handling
- Eliminated multiple client creation points

### 4. Improved Failover Handling

- Introduced `IFailoverCoordinator` interface and `FailoverCoordinator` implementation
- Encapsulated complex vs simple failover strategies
- Improved type safety and readability

### 5. Early Configuration Normalization

- Added `_normalize_config` method to `ApplicationBuilder` to normalize configuration shapes early
- Ensured consistent types throughout the application
- Reduced the need for type checking and branching logic

### 6. Enhanced Testing

- Created unit tests for `BackendConfigProvider` to verify behavior
- Updated existing tests to use proper DI patterns instead of directly modifying internal state
- Added integration tests for startup and backend probing

## Benefits

1. **Improved Modularity**: Clear separation of concerns between components
2. **Better Type Safety**: Consistent types and fewer type casts
3. **Reduced Duplication**: Centralized logic for common operations
4. **Easier Testing**: Components can be tested in isolation
5. **Simplified Debugging**: Clearer flow of data and control

## Future Improvements

1. **Complete Test Coverage**: Add more tests for edge cases
2. **Further Refactoring**: Continue to improve adherence to SOLID principles
3. **Documentation**: Update documentation to reflect the new architecture
4. **Error Handling**: Improve error handling and reporting
